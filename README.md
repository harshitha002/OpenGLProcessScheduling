# OpenGL project, Process Scheduling
CG project,
This repository contains opengl program for simulation of process scheduling algorithms.
Note that the code is not well optimized. 
The algorithms included are,
1. Round Robin
2. First come first serve
3. Shortest job first (Non-preemptive)

To execute the program download the main.cpp file.
then,
$g++ main.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut 

$./a.out
